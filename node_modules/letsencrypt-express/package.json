It's just there for looks.\n* `lex.createAcmeResponder()` is now `lex.middleware(require('redirect-https')())` or `lex.middleware(app)`\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThe oversimplified example was the bait\n(because everyone seems to want an example that fits in 3 lines, even if it's terribly bad practices),\nnow here's the switch:\n\n`serve.js`:\n```javascript\n'use strict';\n\n// returns an instance of node-letsencrypt with additional helper methods\nvar lex = require('letsencrypt-express').create({\n  // set to https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory in production\n  server: 'staging'\n\n// If you wish to replace the default plugins, you may do so here\n//\n, challenges: { 'http-01': require('le-challenge-fs').create({ webrootPath: '/tmp/acme-challenges' }) }\n, store: require('le-store-certbot').create({ webrootPath: '/tmp/acme-challenges' })\n\n// You probably wouldn't need to replace the default sni handler\n// See https://git.daplie.com/Daplie/le-sni-auto if you think you do\n//, sni: require('le-sni-auto').create({})\n\n, approveDomains: approveDomains\n});\n```\n\n```javascript\nfunction approveDomains(opts, certs, cb) {\n  // This is where you check your database and associated\n  // email addresses with domains and agreements and such\n\n\n  // The domains being approved for the first time are listed in opts.domains\n  // Certs being renewed are listed in certs.altnames\n  if (certs) {\n    opts.domains = certs.altnames;\n  }\n  else {\n    opts.email = 'john.doe@example.com';\n    opts.agreeTos = true;\n  }\n\n  // NOTE: you can also change other options such as `challengeType` and `challenge`\n  // opts.challengeType = 'http-01';\n  // opts.challenge = require('le-challenge-fs').create({});\n\n  cb(null, { options: opts, certs: certs });\n}\n```\n\n\n```javascript\n// handles acme-challenge and redirects to https\nrequire('http').createServer(lex.middleware(require('redirect-https')())).listen(80, function () {\n  console.log(\"Listening for ACME http-01 challenges on\", this.address());\n});\n\n\n\nvar app = require('express')();\napp.use('/', function (req, res) {\n  res.end('Hello, World!');\n});\n\n// handles your app\nrequire('https').createServer(lex.httpsOptions, lex.middleware(app)).listen(443, function () {\n  console.log(\"Listening for ACME tls-sni-01 challenges and serve app on\", this.address());\n});\n```\n\n**Security Warning**:\n\nIf you don't do proper checks in `approveDomains(opts, certs, cb)`\nan attacker will spoof SNI packets with bad hostnames and that will\ncause you to be rate-limited and or blocked from the ACME server.\n\n\nAPI\n===\n\nThis module is an elaborate ruse (to provide an oversimplified example and to nab some SEO).\n\nThe API is actually located at [node-letsencrypt options](https://git.daplie.com/Daplie/node-greenlock)\n(because all options are simply passed through to `node-letsencrypt` proper without modification).\n\nThe only \"API\" consists of two options, the rest is just a wrapper around `node-letsencrypt` to take LOC from 15 to 5:\n\n* `opts.app` An express app in the format `function (req, res) { ... }` (no `next`).\n* `lex.listen(plainPort, tlsPort)` Accepts port numbers (or arrays of port numbers) to listen on.\n\nBrief overview of some simple options for `node-letsencrypt`:\n\n* `opts.server` set to https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory in production\n* `opts.email` The default email to use to accept agreements.\n* `opts.agreeTos` When set to `true`, this always accepts the LetsEncrypt TOS. When a string it checks the agreement url first.\n* `opts.approveDomains` can be either of:\n  * An explicit array of allowed domains such as `[ 'example.com', 'www.example.com' ]`\n  * A callback `function (opts, certs, cb) { cb(null, { options: opts, certs: certs }); }` for setting `email`, `agreeTos`, `domains`, etc (as shown in usage example above)\n* `opts.renewWithin` is the **maximum** number of days (in ms) before expiration to renew a certificate.\n* `opts.renewBy` is the **minimum** number of days (in ms) before expiration to renew a certificate.\n",
